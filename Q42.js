// Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
// Step 2: Create the showMagicians function
function showMagicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach((magician) => {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
// Step 3: Create the makeGreat function
function makeGreat(magicians) {
    return magicians.map((magician) => `the Great ${magician}`);
}
// Step 4: Create an array of magician names
const magicianNames = ["Harry Houdini", "David Copperfield", "Penn Jillette", "Teller"];
// Step 5: Call makeGreat to modify the array
const greatMagicians = makeGreat(magicianNames);
// Step 6: Call showMagicians to see the modified list
showMagicians(greatMagicians);
